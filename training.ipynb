    "### Parameters & Hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.    \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### CNN-RNN architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "The CNN-RNN architecture uses a pre-trained ResNet18 as the encoder to extract image features, followed by a linear layer to project them to embed_size=256. The decoder is an LSTM-based RNN with an embedding layer (vocab to embed_size), a single-layer LSTM (input=embed_size, hidden=512), and a linear output to vocab_size. During training, image features are concatenated as the first input to the LSTM sequence, followed by embedded caption words\n",
    "\n",
    "### Trainable Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "All parameters in the decoder (embedding, LSTM, linear) and only the final linear embedding layer in the encoder. This is a good choice because the ResNet18 backbone is pre-trained and frozen (to leverage transfer learning), while the embedding layer adapts features to the decoder's input space\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optimizer\n",
    "\n",
    "Adam because it's widely used in image captioning for its adaptive learning rates, momentum, and stability on noisy gradients. lr=0.001 is a standard starting point"
